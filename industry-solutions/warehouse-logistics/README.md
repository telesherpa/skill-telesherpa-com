# Warehouse logistics (Telesherpa industry solution)

**Version 1.0.** Location: `industry-solutions/warehouse-logistics/`, next to
`telesherpa-ontology-platform/` and `industry-solutions/shift-planning/`, on the
draft branch `draft/warehouse-logistics-1.0`. It is not merged to main.

**Read aloud:** [READ-ALOUD.md](READ-ALOUD.md) is a single speakable document of this skill,
for reading the draft aloud from the public raw URL.

**Start here:** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Load the platform skill first
(`telesherpa-ontology-platform/SKILL.md`).

An agent can set up QR labels, packages and stock bookings on the same hosted MCP as
shift planning: three scopes (master data, warehouse, team), packages that carry
quantity, lot and best-before, labels with their own codes (not the object id), a
single-scan bind and a leadership rebind, Avery 3475 print sheets, and single-scan
putaway, pick, relocate and count — each writing a movement and updating the package
quantity.

The high-level operating model — flows, the agent's control loop and the limits —
is in [references/operating-model.md](references/operating-model.md).

Relative links to the platform skill and to `shift-planning` are written for the
published tree `industry-solutions/warehouse-logistics/` next to those folders; they
do not resolve from this draft path.

People, sites and the three-scope pattern are reused from
[shift-planning](../shift-planning/SKILL.md); do not invent a second copy.
